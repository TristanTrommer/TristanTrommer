As a Software Engineer passionate about building robust and scalable solutions, I thrive in dynamic teams where technology drives real-world impact. My experience spans from hands-on product development and cloud infrastructure to cross-team collaboration in agile environments. With a strong foundation in software engineering and a track record of rapidly acquiring new technologies, I consistently deliver high-quality, efficient code and innovative solutions.

Eager to continuously grow and contribute, I believe in learning by doing, sharing insights, and championing best practices for the success of my team and organization.
